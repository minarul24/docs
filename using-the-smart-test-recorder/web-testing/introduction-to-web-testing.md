# Introduction to Web Testing

When it comes to test automation, one area of testing that many teams need to focus on is testing websites. TestProject gives you powerful testing tools that are designed to make the job of a tester working in this area much easier. 

The [TestProject recorder](creating-a-web-test-using-the-testproject-recorder.md) makes it easy to create and edit tests, and the built in management tools make it easy to manage, share and run tests against the various platforms and browsers that your team needs to consider.  Websites are core to the business models of many companies and so web testing is a critical thing for many testing teams to engage in. With the TestProject web testing tools you are able to work on this type of testing in an effective and streamlined way. 

## Getting Ready

Before you create your first web test, you will need to have a project that you can store it in. A project helps you manage all tests related to the project you are working on, and is also designed around the idea of collaboration. You can add an unlimited number of users to a project giving them the permissions you want, which makes it easy for an entire team to work together on testing a project.

When you first start using TestProject, it will prompt you to create a new project.

Once you have created that intial project, you can add additional projects from the project selector dropdown:

Once you give your project a name and description and create it, TestProject will take you to the tests page for that project. From here you can do a few things. You can create tests, create jobs, add elements or add data sources for data driven tests and more!

## Next Step

You are now ready to start creating your first web test in TestProject. You can see how to do that in our [step by step tutorial ](creating-a-web-test-using-the-testproject-recorder.md)on creating a web tests with the TestProject recorder.
