# v0.55

### New Features and Improvements

* **Easy job scheduling** - We've made job scheduling easier than ever. To schedule a job or change an existing schedule, just click the scheduler icon on your job. If the icon is orange it means that the job is scheduled for future execution, hover over the icon to see when it will run.

* **Finding Job Tests** - While looking at the test list of a specific job, click the "Go to Test" button to quickly jump to the location of that test. The relevant folder will be opened and the test will be slightly highlighted for 30 seconds.

* **Folder Navigation** - From now on, if you go into a sub-folder within a project and then hit the browser _BACK_ button, you will return to the previous folder that you've visited.
* **Search Enhancements** - All search boxes across the platform will now display an **X** button when searching. Clicking on it or hitting the **ESC** key on your keyboard will clear the search filtering.
* **Saving Elements** - When manually saving an element in the recorder, all element information is being populated automatically. All you have left to do is give it a proper name, description and that's it.
