# v0.54

### New Features and Improvements

* **Enhanced job notifications** - We've added new options for job notifications in addition to the existing functionality that sends webhooks/email notifications upon job execution finish. Just click the ![notification](https://storage-static.testproject.io/release-notes/0.54/notification.png) icon to open job notification settings. You now have the option to:
  * Get notifications once a job has finished and decide if you want to receive them only in case the job has failed.
  * Get webhooks or/and email notifications when your job starts.
* **Elements description** - Description property was added to elements to hold additional element information. This contributes to long term maintenance as well as provides additional info when searching for existing elements.
* **Partial steps execution** - This great enhancement allows you easier development and debugging of your tests. While recording your test, you can select several steps and click the dedicated **run** button to run only those steps.

* **Project users** - We've added an easy option for account admins to see all the users and API keys that have access to a project. Just click on the context menu of any project and then on the **Users** option.

* **Latest job report** - There is now a convenient indicator for the latest job execution result. The indicator was initially introduced for tests and now has made its way to jobs as well. You will see the indicator on any job that has been executed at least once. It will be red or green to indicate the result of the execution. Clicking on it will take you directly to the relevant report.

* **Recorder element mapping** - As a continuous effort, we are constantly improving element auto mapping while recording new tests or editing existing ones. This release contains an additional step into that direction. Android elements will now be better and more uniquely defined using the **content description** of an element when possible. This enhancement does not change any previous behaviors and you can still manually adjust all of your elements as before.

* In case mobile applications lock the device in landscape mode, the recorder device mirror will now be adjusted automatically.
* Fixed an issue when modifying **sub-tests** while recording/editing was not reflected until the recorder was reopened.
* Changing orientation of iOS devices when recording is now working as expected.
