### New Features

* [TestProject API](https://docs.testproject.io/api/v2/) was enhanced and now has additional actions among many other already available. It is now possible to create and update jobs, upload coded test packages and assign tests \(coded or recorded\) to jobs.
* Mobile element explorer - We've added a great and very intuitive Element Explorer for mobile applications. You can now easily browse through the DOM of your application and get to any element to see it's location and attributes!
