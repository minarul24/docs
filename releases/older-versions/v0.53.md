* Test documents - You can easily export your test document and a manual test template to an Excel document from the test context menu, read more regarding manual test template export [here](https://blog.testproject.io/2019/06/29/the-best-manual-test-case-templates/).
* Parameter auto generation - When adding steps that use a sub-test, you will now have an option to automatically create all input parameters of the used test in the current test to allow passing data all the way to the sub-test. You can save a lot of time by no longer needing to create all the parameters by yourself.
