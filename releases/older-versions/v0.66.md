# v0.66

### New Features and Improvements

**Automation Assistant** - In the last few versions we've introduced various [AI capabilities](https://testproject.io/ai-tools/) like self-healing elements and an advance adaptive wait mechanism, and we are not stopping there. In this version, we've added the automation assistant. The automation assistant was created to reduce test flakiness \(for example, actions that are reported as passed but didn’t actually do what they were supposed to\). The assistant achieves this by analyzing each step and detecting cases where an action didn’t reach its target goal, then attempts to fix it automatically. This feature is automatically enabled for all new tests, so you don't have to do anything special. If you wish to disable it, just go to test settings and turn it off.

**Bring it on!** - Following the release of our [OpenSDK](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/opensdk-v2), we are happy to say that you can now upload Java and C\# tests that were written using one of them to TestProject platform. No matter which test framework you use, all the tests will be reflected in the cloud and you and your teammates will be able to easily run them from anywhere.

**BDD Style** - Our OpenSDK now supports various [BDD](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/behavior-driven-development) frameworks to allow you to do what you know and love while utilizing all the benefits for TestProject. Check out the documentation for [C\# SpecFlow](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/behavior-driven-development/c-and-specflow-bdd), [Java Cucumber](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/behavior-driven-development/cucumber-java), and [Python Behave](https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/behavior-driven-development/behave-python) for more info and examples.

**Show me the Code** - Python is often being used by automation developers which are an important part of our growing community, so it was a logical choice to add the Python code generation in addition to the existing Java and C\# options.

**Reporting & Dashboards Facelift** - Reporting plays a huge role in our day-to-day testing and debugging efforts. We know just how crucial it is to have detailed test reports that you can trust, so we've made it a high priority to provide just that. We gave our existing reports a whole new look & feel and fixed some UX issues to provide you with the best reporting experience possible.

**Let's Get Virtual** - The much-anticipated support for iOS simulators has arrived! From now on, you can use physical devices and/or simulators - the choice is yours. And the cool thing is that with our out-of-the-box support for iOS simulators you do not need to have an Apple Developer account or a provisioning profile. You can simply launch your simulator and TestProject's Agent will automatically detect it.
