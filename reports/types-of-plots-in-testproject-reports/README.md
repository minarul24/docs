# Types of Plots in TestProject Reports

There are several different kinds of charts that TestProject automatically creates for you. Each of these plots helps you explore different aspects of the test run data to answer the many different questions you want to investigate when creating automated tests.

These charts are available as summaries for all the tests you have run, or as a summary of each project you've defined in TestProject. You also have the ability to filter the data that you want to show up on each chart. There are some useful built in options for quick filtering like `Last 30 days` or `Last 20 Executions` or if you want you can create a custom date range for the chart. In order to change the range of the chart, go to the select range dropdown on the left of the page and choose the option you want.
